###2 hour###

Still trying to install linux for the second time
In the meantime I tryed to get the other laptop to run new ram etc.
installation went thro 
didnt work
trying to use the other laptop
got one to work
have to make some software changes 
In the end I got only one to work. That is not a problem because the secreen is cracked and the Laptop has only 4gb ram.
