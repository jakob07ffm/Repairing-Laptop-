I received two laptops as gifts from my school and attempted to repair them. I managed to fix one, while I salvaged parts from the other.

First, I tested both laptops to see if they would boot. One of them did, but not correctly. I then tried to install Linux on it. While Linux was installing, I cleaned the other laptop. Unfortunately, the Linux installation wasn't successful on the first try, so I attempted it again.

While waiting for the installation, I cleaned the fan of the second laptop. The Linux installation failed the first time, but on the second attempt, it went through. However, the installation still didnâ€™t work properly.

Meanwhile, I tried to get the second laptop running with new RAM and other upgrades. Eventually, I managed to get one laptop working. I needed to make some software changes, and in the end, only one laptop was fully operational. This wasn't a big issue since the second laptop had a cracked screen and only 4GB of RAM.
